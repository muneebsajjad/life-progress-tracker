# Life Progress Tracker

A dynamic visualization tool that helps you track and manage different aspects of your life using an interactive sunburst chart. This project was born from the desire to have a holistic view of personal growth and life balance.

## Motivation

In our fast-paced world, it's easy to lose track of the various aspects of our lives that contribute to overall well-being. This tool helps you:

- Visualize your progress across 8 key life areas
- Track multiple sub-categories within each life area
- Maintain a balanced approach to personal development
- Identify areas that need more attention
- Set and monitor personal growth goals

The sunburst visualization provides an intuitive way to see how different aspects of your life are developing, making it easier to maintain balance and focus on areas that need improvement.

## Features

- Interactive sunburst chart visualization
- Real-time updates with slider controls
- Persistent storage of progress data
- Color-coded categories for easy recognition
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/muneebsajjad/life-progress-tracker.git
   cd life-progress-tracker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   yarn start-server
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
